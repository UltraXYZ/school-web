                        Many students
                        enjoy playing there, and even go there after school to play and have fun with their friends. We
                        hope that if
                        your child comes over to CRS, he/she enjoys our newly updated playground as well! (The picture

                    <p> Level 1 (Critical and Creative Thinking Lessons)
                        is provided to students grades K-6, and consists of model lessons that are designed to teach
                        critical and creative thinking skills. The lessons are modeled in all classrooms by Advanced
                        Academic Resource Teachers (AARTs) and the thinking strategies are then used throughout the year
                        by
                        classroom and other teachers who work with students. Student responses to these lessons are used
                        as
                        part of the identification process for Levels II-IV. Parents may also practice these strategies
                        during family conversations and activities. In Level 2 (Differentiated Lessons in Areas of
                        Academic
                        Strength, Grades ), the AART collaborates with classroom teachers to provide additional
                        challenges
                        through lessons and resources that extend and enrich the Program of Studies. Screening for this
                        level of service is ongoing throughout the school year. For Level 3 (Part-Time Advanced Academic
                        Programs), students identified by our local Advanced Academic committee work directly with the
                        AART
                        each week in a small group setting. </p>

                    <p> The school offers many extra activities because we have multiple rooms for our students to
                        show of their true skill in peace. For an example the drawing club is for students to
                        excel at drawing by being teached by famous painter Bedwyr Williams. In the computer club the
                        students are teached
                        by an expert in html and css, Harshit Srivastava. In the cooking class they learn only from the
                        best with the finest
                        chef in the world, Nick Giovanni who is in the top 20 best chefs in the world. These classes are
                        free
                        and don't require any money from the parent/guardian as all material is given to student by
                        school. Some clubs may need parent/guardian
                        permission such as the movie club because caregivers might not be comfortable with their kid on
                        camera. </p>

                    <h5 class="text-capitalize text-left text-success">The point system</h5>
                    <p> We understand that being a great role model for kids is very hard.
                        Instead in our school we do a point system in which when a child does a good deed he/she gets a
                        point.
                        If a child helped open the door: he would get 1 point. If a child help the teacher after school
                        to clean the classroom they
                        get 3 points etc. The greater the deed the more points. They can exchange points for prizes such
                        as 5 points gives you a pencil,
                        30 points give you a pencil case, 90 points for a note book, and our biggest prize is for 200
                        points = a king sized chocolate bar.
                        We change our prizes every month so students don't get bored of the same prizes. </p>
